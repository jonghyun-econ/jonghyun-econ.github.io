<h3><a href="/assets/pdf/jmp.pdf" target="_blank">Social Learning with Coarse Communication</a></h3>

**Abstract:** We study social learning in networks when communication is restricted to a finite vocabulary. Because messages are generated by a coarse quantizer, social information is piecewise constant and evolves only through threshold crossings. This creates a bandwidth--mixing mismatch: faster network mixing shrinks cross-sectional dispersion, yet dispersion is required to trigger threshold crossings. We show that sufficiently fast-mixing networks exhibit homogenization traps: with non-vanishing probability, the society enters an absorbing message region where a large cohesive core becomes permanently locked in, generating an information ceiling..
